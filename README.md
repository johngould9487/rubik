# How to solve a Rubik's cube

1.  **Construct the daisy**

    -   Construct the yellow center and surround with four white edges

2.  **Create a white cross**

    -   Match other square on white edge with same coloured centre
        square on its face

    -   Rotate that face twice

    -   Repeat for other 'daisy petals'

3.  **Get whites on to the bottom layer**

    -   Turn white square onto bottom

    -   find white squares on top layer (not top face)

    -   Turn top layer such that square adjacent to white is diagonal to
        center square of same colour

    -   Perform right/left trigger accordingly

    -   If white is bottom layer, trigger it to top layer

    -   If white on top face, rotate top layer such that white is above
        a non-white on bottom face Perform right/trigger twice to move
        it to top row and repeat as before

    -   Repeat until bottom face is all white. Bottom layer is also
        solved

4.  **Solve the second layer**

    -   Find edge piece on top layer that do NOT contain yellow

    -   Create 'T' on one face

    -   Look to see if top face colour above 'T' is matched with centre
        square on left or right face

    -   Pull top layer once with right(left) index finger if match is on
        right(left) then perform right(left) trigger

    -   Reposition displace white square as before

    -   Continue until second layer is solved

5.  F U R U' R' F'

    -   To create the yellow cross, inspect the top face

    -   If there are two 'diametrically' opposed yellows, align them
        verically

    -   If there are two edge yellow 90$^{\circ}$ apart, position them
        at 9 and 12 o'Clock

    -   Perform the algorithm

6.  R U R' U R U2 R'

    -   If there are 0 or 2 yellow corners, rotate top face until there
        is a yellow square at the top-right of left face

    -   If there is 1 yellow corner, position it at bottom-left.

    -   Perform the algorithm and repeat until yellow face is solved

7.  L' U R U' L U2 R' U R U2 R'

    -   If no face has matching upper corners, perform algorithm

    -   If one face has matching upper corners, hold that face to the
        left and perform algorithm

    -   Repeat if necessary

8.  CW: F2 U R' L F2 L' R U F2

    CCW: F2 U' R' L F2 L' R U' F2

    -   If one face is solved, position it to the back and perform CW or
        CCW as needed

    -   If no faces are solved perform either CW or CCW twice
